## long winter

long winter, huh?
headphones on to dull the sound
gulls swirling in the morning sun
trains still running, delayed

still a light wind's chill
robe on, legs exposed
swirling, floating, hunting
water-logged oil laden truck

the buzz of ants below
garbage men unloading
arteries of delivery
seen from so high up

no wifi outside
but i lay back anyway
it's been a long winter
is this just a tease?
